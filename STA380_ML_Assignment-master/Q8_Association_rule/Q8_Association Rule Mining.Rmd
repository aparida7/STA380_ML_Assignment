```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(arules)  # has a big ecosystem of packages built around it
library(arulesViz)
```

```{r}
#read the .txt file
data <- readLines("groceries.txt")
```

```{r}
# Split items and create a transaction dataset
transactions <- strsplit(data, ",")
```

```{r}
# Remove duplicate items within transactions
transactions_list_clean <- lapply(transactions, function(transaction) unique(transaction))
```

```{r}
# Cast this variable as a special arules "transactions" class.
transactions_clean <- as(transactions_list_clean, "transactions")
```

```{r}
# Lets look at our baskets
inspect(head(transactions_clean) )
```

```{r}
#Number of baskets
dim(transactions_clean)[1]
```

```{r}
#Top 10 most selling items
itemFrequencyPlot(transactions_clean,topN=10,type='absolute',main = "Top 10 items in baskets")
```

```         
```

The data set has 9835 rows/baskets.

Most commonly bought products are:

1)  Whole milk

2)  other vegetables

3)  rolls/buns

#### **Trying support=0.05 and confidence=0.1**

```{r}
#Trying support=0.05 and confidence=0.1
m= apriori(transactions_clean,parameter=list(support=.005, confidence=0.1))
summary(m)
```

This gives 1582 rules. Too many!!

Let's try to increase our confidence to 0.2

```{r}
m1= apriori(transactions_clean,parameter=list(support=.005, confidence=0.2))
summary(m1)
```

Now, we have 873 rules. Still pretty high!

```{r}
# plot all the rules in (support, confidence) space
plot(m,jitters=0)
```

N

```{r}
plot(m, measure = c("support", "lift"), shading = "confidence")
```

```{r}
#Using the subsets obtained from plots to identify the approximate lift and confidence thresholds
#inspect(subset(m, ci=onfidence >0.4 ))
#inspect(subset(m, lift >2))
inspect(subset(m, confidence > 0.4 & lift >2))

```

172 rules.

**Lets plot the graph to visualize associations**

```{r}
grocery_graph = associations2igraph(subset(m, subset=lift >2 & confidence >=0.4), associationsAsNodes = FALSE)
igraph::write_graph(grocery_graph, file='grocery_vis.graphml', format = "graphml")
```

Association

Findings:

1.  As seen from the bar plot earlier, whole milk and other vegetables are the most bought items (high degree).

2.  We can see two clusters here-one centered around "whole milk" and other centered around "other vegetables". Purchase of other items often lead to purchase of these items.

3.  Probability of purchasing Whole milk increases when there is purchase of yogurt, curd,rolls/buns.

4.  Probability of purchasing other vegetables increase when people purchase root vegetables or fruits (pip fruits/tropical fruits/citrus fruits)

5.  We can see that there is association between purchase of "whole milk" and other **dairy** **products** like yogurt, curd, butter while "other vegetables: is mainly associated with purchase of **fresh produce** like fruits and vegetables and items like beef and pork.
